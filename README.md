Clustering
Clustering is one of the most common exploratory data analysis technique used to get an intuition about the structure of the data. It can be defined as the task of identifying subgroups in the data such that data points in the same subgroup (cluster) are very similar while data points in different clusters are very different. 

K means
Kmeans algorithm is an algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group.

#Kmeans gives more weight to the bigger clusters.

In our project we have created a cluster for columns.There are total 5 clusters with their centroids.We have visualized the dataset by using histogram and box plot.
These clusters are useful in finding the relation of the data which are related with each other and hence forming groups accordingly.If data is in groups we can visuallize it better.
